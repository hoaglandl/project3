         <h2>What do I need to know before playing?</h2>
          <p>The beautiful thing about Animal Crossing is that you don’t actually need any tips or advice before playing. In fact, you don’t need any gaming experience at all! Many players, especially those in younger age groups, are happy just running around the island shaking trees for fruit and playing dress-up (and if I’m honest, sometimes I like doing that, too). The tips and tricks I’ll share with you aren’t necessary to enjoy the game, but they help make the most of your time playing and help you explore some more creativity that the game has to offer. The gameplay tips below are to help you when you’re stuck, bored with your island, or want to check out a new challenge within the community.</p>

         <h2>Fishing Tips</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite pastimes in Animal Crossing is fishing. There’s just a little extra skill involved – enough to be a challenge at times, but still a lot of fun! Here are some of the things to keep in mind next time you pick up your fishing rod:</p>

          <img src="images/black-bass.jpg" alt="black bass" title="Black Bass">
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Look for the swimming shadows.</strong> In your oceans, ponds, and rivers, you will see teardrop-shaped shadows swimming in the water. You’ll have to find one before you cast your line into the water. Try to cast as close to the shadow as you can, and keep an eye on that bobber! As soon as it goes under, reel it in with the A button to get your catch.</li>

              <li><strong>Don’t run!</strong> A lot of times, I’ll find myself running up and down the beach waiting for the next fish shadow to appear. But fishing is sneaky work, which means you have to go slow and steady. Running will scare the fish before you can even cast your line!</li>

              <li><strong>Craft some bait. </strong>Digging up manila clams on the seashore will serve as perfect bait for your big catch. Just dig up a few and then head to a crafting bench. It takes one clam to make one fish bait, which you can scatter anywhere in a water area and a fish shadow will appear! This is especially helpful on the pier, where rare fish are known to spawn.</li>

              <li><strong>Bells, Bells, Bells! </strong> Fishing is probably my number one way of earning bells, especially if CJ is in town to buy them from you! You can sell fish at Nook’s Cranny and fill your pockets with plenty of bells pretty quickly. Some fish are worth more than others, like sharks. </li>


            </ol>

         <h2>Bug Catching Tips</h2>
          <p>Bug catching is slightly harder than fishing, because it’s all about being slow and steady. Just like in fishing, timing your catch perfectly is the key. Here are some tips to ensure you don’t miss out on those rare catches:</p>

          <img src="images/bug-off.jpg" alt="bug-off" title="Bug-Off">
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Slow and steady. </strong> The bugs will scare like the fish if you run or even bump the tree or rock they are perched on. The best tactic is to get your net ready holding down the A button, and then slowly approach the bug until you’re in catching range. It takes some practice, but this is helpful when you’re on the hunt for beetles or other bugs that are perched.</li>

              <li><strong>Watch out for water! </strong>If you’re chasing one of the creepy crawlies that scurry around on the ground, such as a grasshopper, you might accidentally chase it into the river! Steer clear of water features, or back off for a bit if the bug approaches a pond or riverbed.</li>

              <li><strong>Tarantulas and scorpions don’t have to be scary. </strong> I know, they are honestly the most terrifying part of this game (other than the night clowns that your villagers may bring up every once in a while). The trick to catching these spooky but rare bugs is to hold your net ready and take a few steps forward, pausing, and then continuing forward, and repeat. This will allow you to get close enough without getting attacked.</li>

              <li><strong>Plant lots of flowers. </strong>Although bugs can spawn anywhere on your island, most are drawn to flowers. By planting more flowers, you’re offering more areas for more bugs to spawn. This can come in handy when you want to catch a specific type to give to a villager or sell for some extra bells.</li>

         <h2>Hybrid Flowers</h2>
          <p>One of the challenges in Animal Crossing is to create every color and type of flower possible. You can get the basics from Nooks Cranny or sold from Leif at his cart, but these are usually of the red, yellow, and white variety. You can create beautiful pink, blue, purple, and green flowers using a very specific breeding technique. The basic idea is to plant starter flowers in the same vicinity so that when they’re watered and grow a new flower, it becomes a hybrid between the two starters. Some hybrids are easy to create, while others take a lot more patience and luck. Check out this video to learn the best way to plant your flowers in order to get every hybrid possible:</p>
